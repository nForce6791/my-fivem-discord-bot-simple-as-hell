## Getting Started

Make sure you have nodejs installed, or else it will not work. Once you have node.js installed, go to CMD Prompt, CD into the directory that you have your bot in, and write `npm i`, then to start the bot, do `node .`


## What is this bot?

It's just a simple discord bot that I use for my FiveM server, nForceRP. 
 - It allows you to accept applications/deny applications
 - Allows you to "hack" another person
 - Pings the bot

Literally a super simple bot. 

Base of the bot was from https://github.com/SuperSweatyTejas/Discord.js-v12-Bot-template, but I added a decent amount of things + I edited and removed mongoDB.

Yes, I know there's an actual bot token in config.json, I reset it, so that one doesn't work anymore. 

Do anything you want with it. Anything you may need to change is in the command files, and anything else is in config.json.

Make sure you have developer mode turned on (user settings -> advanced -> developer mode)

You need that to get the server id and role ids, which are needed in multiple parts of the bot.


Do *anything* you want with this bot, just please, if you reupload, credit me and SuperSweatyTejas. Thanks
